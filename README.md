Correlation and regression relationship between countries GDP per capita and Life Expectancy

For this project, I would like to see if there is a relationship between the GDP per capita of a country and the life expectancy of its citizens.

I utilized Python libraries and languages and MySQL workbench to conduct this analysis.

In the end, I discovered that there is some positive relationship between GDP per capita and Life Expectancy. So, it is possible that high GDP per capita lead to higher years of life. 

However, we must be aware of the several other lurking variables that may also influence life expectancy. These include Gender, Government spending on health, Crime rates, Mortality rate, Access to Healthcare, Average citizen level of education etc.
